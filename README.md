##1. Principles

> "Part of being a good steward to a successful project is realizing that
> writing code for yourself is a Bad Ideaâ„¢. If thousands of people are using
> your code, then write your code for maximum clarity, not your personal
> preference of how to get clever within the spec." - Idan Gazit

*Don't try to prematurely optimize your code; keep it readable and understandable.
*All code in any code-base should look like a single person typed it, even when many people are contributing to it.
*Strictly enforce the agreed-upon style.
*If in doubt when deciding upon a style use existing, common patterns.

## 2. Whitespace

*Configure your IDE to use soft-tabs with a two space indent. Spaces are the only way 
 to guarantee code renders the same in any person's environment.
*Add a space after the : in property declarations.
*Separate each ruleset by a blank line.
*Place individual selectors on a single line.
*Place closing braces of selectors on their own line.
*Include a space after each comma in comma-separated property or function values.
*Place all selectors on their own line for readability and more accurate error handling.
*Large blocks of single declarations can use a single-line format. In this case, a space should be included after the opening brace and before the closing brace.
